Feature,Design Detail,Rationale

Scope of Communication,Email Only.,"Keeps the service simple and focused. SMS/Push notifications would be separate, specialized microservices later."
Sending Method,Third-Party Provider (SendGrid).,"Delegates deliverability, reputation management, and high-volume sending to a specialized vendor, keeping your core services fast."
Core Data (Local Storage),Email Templates and Delivery Logs.,Templates are stored locally (or pulled from CMS) for performance. Logs are stored to maintain an audit trail of communication.
B. Communication Flow and Templates 4. Inbound API (The Universal Endpoint) All other microservices will use this single, simple endpoint to request an email send:

Proposal: POST /v1/notify/email

Request Payload (Minimum): Requires only the recipient_email, template_id (a name like 'ORDER_CONFIRM'), and a JSON object for template_data (e.g., {"order_number": 123}).

Asynchronous Handling To prevent your main services (like Checkout) from slowing down, the service must process emails in the background.
Proposal: Immediate 202 Accepted response and Queueing.

Action: Upon receiving a request, the service immediately places the email job into an internal message queue (like AWS SQS). It then returns a 202 response to the calling service (Checkout), which can proceed instantly. A background worker pulls jobs from the queue and sends them via SendGrid.

Template Integration The service should own the assembly of the final email, but the content should be managed by the Marketing team via the CMS.
Proposal: Pull Templates from CMS.

Action: When a job is pulled from the queue, the Email service calls the CMS Microservice API: GET /v1/content/template/{template_id} to fetch the current HTML/Plain Text structure. It then merges this template with the template_data from the job payload.

C. Error Handling and Audit Feature Design Detail Rationale 7. Failure Logging Data Stored: timestamp, recipient_email, template_id, and failure_reason (from SendGrid). Provides a simple audit trail for customer service and internal debugging (e.g., proving an email was sent). 8. Throttling Yes, implemented. Protects the domain reputation. This is done by configuring a rate limit (e.g., X emails per minute) on the internal queue worker before connecting to SendGrid.

This blueprint ensures the Email service is fast, reliable, and decoupled from your core revenue processes.
