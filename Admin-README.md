. UI Composition and AccessFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale1. UI Data AggregationDirect API Calls (Client-Side Aggregation). The Admin UI calls multiple backend APIs directly (e.g., calls the CRM API for customer name, then calls the Billing API for invoice list).Speed & Simplicity: For complex reporting, it relies on the Analytics service. For real-time views, it's simpler for the Admin UI to call all necessary microservices directly and assemble the data on the client side.2. Access GranularityRole-Based Filtering (Client-Side & Backend): The Admin UI filters views based on the JWT Claims (e.g., only show the "Dispute Console" if the user has the SLYYFOXX_ADMIN role). Crucially, the backend microservices (CRM, Billing) run a second filter to ensure the MERCHANT only retrieves data related to their own account.Defense in Depth: The UI provides a good experience (hiding unauthorized buttons), while the backend provides the non-negotiable security boundary.3. Content SourceCMS API: Calls the CMS Microservice API (GET /v1/content/item/internal-faq) to fetch all internal support guides, release notes, and policy text.Decoupling: Keeps all documentation management centralized in the CMS, allowing non-developers to update guides instantly.

B. Management WorkflowsFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale4. Order Management ViewCalls the Workflow Orchestrator API.Source of Truth: The Orchestrator owns the current state and history of the multi-step fulfillment SAGA. The Admin UI calls the Orchestrator (e.g., GET /v1/workflows/status/{order_id}) to show the manager where the order is stalled.5. Refund WorkflowCalls the Escrow Microservice API.Financial Control: Since Escrow manages the conditional fund state, the Admin UI calls the Escrow API (POST /v1/escrow/refund/{id}) to initiate the refund. Escrow then handles the internal communication with the Billing Microservice to execute the money movement.6. Reporting DataAnalytics API: Calls GET /v1/reports/sales-by-tier (from Analytics). PM API: Calls GET /v1/reports/capacity-summary (from Project Management).The Admin dashboard is built using aggregated, high-performance data provided by the specialized Analytics a

C. Developer Portal IntegrationFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale7. 3rd-Party Credential ManagementAPI Call to Integrations Microservice: POST /v1/integrations/key/{merchant_id}/generateThe Admin UI calls the Integrations API to manage the merchant's keys. The Integrations Microservice handles the decryption and secure storage, keeping the Admin UI out of the security perimeter.
