Feature,Design Detail (Proposal),Rationale

Content Source,GET /v1/content/page/landing-home (from CMS Microservice),"Efficiency: Calls one single, clean API endpoint that returns the entire page's content structure (text, image URLs, pricing hooks) in a single JSON payload."
Speed Strategy,Static Site Generation (SSG).,"Absolute Fastest Load Time: Since the content rarely changes, SSG pre-renders the HTML file at build time. This static file is then pushed to the CDN (CloudFront), resulting in near-instantaneous load times, which is essential for conversion and SEO."
Authentication Trigger,Direct Redirect: Redirects the user's browser to https://sso.slyyfoxxmedia.com/login.,"Security: The Landing Page never touches credentials. It delegates all authentication responsibility to the secure, dedicated SSO Microservice."
Feature,Design Detail (Proposal),Rationale 4. Purpose Limit,"Rule: The service must never contain a database, session logic, or transactional code.",Decoupling: This isolation ensures the Landing Page can be scaled indefinitely and cannot be the source of a data breach. 5. Analytics Tracking,Embedded Tracking Script. The page embeds a lightweight JavaScript tracker that emits a page_view event to the Analytics Microservice via a pixel or tracker endpoint.,Data Collection: This allows the Analytics service to record public traffic and marketing metrics. 6. Navigation,"Direct External Links. All buttons and links (e.g., to Marketplace, Blog, Social) use the full external subdomains: https://market.slyyfoxxmedia.com, etc.",Simplicity: The direct links allow the API Gateway to handle routing without requiring the Landing Page code to manage complex internal logic.
